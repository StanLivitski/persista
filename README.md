What is persista?
==================

Persista is a framework for Java Standard Edition applications that store
relational data according to the [JPA specification][JPA-spec]. It helps
application developers use [JPA][] for data storage without the expense and
complexity of an Enterprise Edition deployment.  

Persista provides an application with database initialization and management
facilities, and sets up [Hibernate][] to enable [JPA][] data access.  

<a name="sec-depends"> </a>
Project's dependencies
======================

Persista uses the infrastructure of [Springlet][] framework and [proper2][]
library to provide the application with a container, command-line interface,
configuration, and logging. It relies on the [Hibernate ORM][Hibernate] to
generate database schema and provide [JPA][] data access.

The following table lists the framework's dependencies. You must have all
these components when you compile the framework. When running persista's tests,
tools, or applications, your classpath has to include their transitive
dependencies as well.

</table>

Persista does not interact with a database server directly, and the
technologies it uses to access and manage data are portable across servers.
Thus, persista should work with any database management system compatible
with [JDBC][] and [Hibernate][]. Persista was written and tested with a
[MySQL][] server version 5.5 storing its databases.

Building persista
================

To build the framework's binary from this repository, you need:

   - A **Java SDK**, also known as JDK, Standard Edition (SE), version 6 or
   later, available from OpenJDK <http://openjdk.java.net/> or Oracle
   <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>.

   Even though a Java runtime may already be installed on your machine
   (check that by running `java --version`), the build will fail if you
   don't have a complete JDK (check that by running `javac`).

   - **Apache Ant** version 1.7.1 or newer, available from the Apache Software
   Foundation <http://ant.apache.org/>.

   - [Dependency libraries](#sec-depends), or links thereto in the `lib/`
   subdirectory of your working copy.

To build the core of persista, go to the directory containing its working copy
and run:

     ant jar

The result is a file named `persista.jar` in the `dist` directory.

To build the unit test components of persista, go to the directory containing a
working copy of persista and run:

     ant test-jar

The result is a file named `persista-test.jar` in the `dist` directory. To build
this target, you must have the optional [Junit dependency](#sec-depends) in the
`lib` directory.

<a name="sec-javadoc"> </a>
Building Javadoc
================

To build Javadoc for the project, make sure you have met the prerequisites
[listed above](#sec-building), go to the directory containing a working copy of
project's sources and run:

     ant javadoc

The result will be placed in the `javadoc` subdirectory.
